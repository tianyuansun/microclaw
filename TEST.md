# MicroClaw Testing Guide

This document describes how to test every feature of MicroClaw. It includes both automated tests (unit/integration) and manual black-box functional tests organized by user stories.

## Automated Tests

```sh
cargo test              # Run all unit + integration tests
cargo clippy            # Lint check
cargo fmt --check       # Format check
```

## Black-Box Functional Tests

Since MicroClaw is a multi-platform bot with external dependencies (LLM APIs, Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp APIs, DuckDuckGo), many features require live interaction testing.

### Prerequisites

1. A working `microclaw.config.yaml` file with valid credentials
2. `cargo build` succeeds with zero errors
3. Bot is running: `cargo run -- start`
4. A Telegram account to send messages
5. (For group tests) A Telegram group with the bot added as a member

## Platform Adapter Template (Future Channels)

Use this checklist when adding a new platform adapter (for example Slack/Feishu/Teams).

### Adapter metadata

- Platform name: `<platform>`
- Inbound mode: `<webhook|gateway|polling>`
- Identity key mapping: `<platform chat/channel/user IDs -> stable chat_id>`
- Reply trigger policy: `<dm always / group mention / allowlist>`
- Message length limit: `<N chars>`
- Attachment support: `<yes/no + types>`

### Test matrix

| # | User Story | Steps | Expected |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|
| P.1 | Private/DM reply | Send direct message | Bot responds |
| P.2 | Group/channel no trigger | Send group message without trigger | No reply; message persistence matches policy |
| P.3 | Group/channel trigger | Mention or trigger bot in group/channel | Bot responds |
| P.4 | Long response splitting | Ask for response > platform limit | Split correctly at boundary with no truncation |
| P.5 | Session reset | Send `/reset` equivalent | Session cleared for this platform chat |
| P.6 | Session resume | Multi-turn chat -> restart bot -> continue | Session restored from DB |
| P.7 | Attachment ingress | Send supported attachment | Parsed/handled with expected behavior |
| P.8 | Attachment egress | Trigger `send_message` with attachment | Delivery succeeds or clear error reported |
| P.9 | Channel allowlist | Configure adapter channel allowlist | Replies limited to configured channels |
| P.10 | Ignore bot/system messages | Send from another bot/system user | Bot does not self-trigger or loop |
| P.11 | API failure handling | Simulate platform API/network failure | Error logged; process stays healthy |
| P.12 | Rate limit handling | Trigger adapter/platform rate limit | Backoff/retry policy works, no crash |

### Persistence and schema checks

- `messages` rows are written with correct `chat_id`, `sender_name`, `is_from_bot`, and timestamp.
- `sessions` row key remains stable for the same platform conversation across restarts.
- `chats.chat_type` semantics are consistent with trigger policy.
- Scheduled task replies route correctly back to the originating platform chat.

### Security and authorization checks

- `control_chat_ids` policy is enforced for cross-chat tools.
- Tool safety boundaries (path guard, restricted tools) remain unchanged by adapter.
- Mention parsing cannot be spoofed by plain text edge cases.

## Database Verification

After running tests, verify the database directly:

```sh
sqlite3 microclaw.data/runtime/microclaw.db

-- Check messages are stored
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages;

-- Check scheduled tasks
SELECT * FROM scheduled_tasks;

-- Check chat records
SELECT * FROM chats;

-- Check sessions
SELECT chat_id, length(messages_json), updated_at FROM sessions;

-- Check task run logs
SELECT * FROM task_run_logs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Cleanup

After testing:

```sh
# Remove test files
rm -f /tmp/microclaw_test.txt /tmp/todos.txt /tmp/test.txt /tmp/session_test.txt

# Cancel any remaining scheduled tasks via the bot, or:
sqlite3 microclaw.data/runtime/microclaw.db "UPDATE scheduled_tasks SET status='cancelled' WHERE status='active';"
```
