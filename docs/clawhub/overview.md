# ClawHub Integration

## What it adds

MicroClaw integrates with ClawHub to search and install skill packs.

- CLI: `microclaw skill search|install|list|inspect`
- Agent tools: `clawhub_search`, `clawhub_install`
- Lockfile: `clawhub.lock.json` (managed install state)

## Storage locations

- Skills directory: `~/.microclaw/skills` (or `$MICROCLAW_HOME/skills`)
- Lockfile: `~/.microclaw/clawhub.lock.json` (or `$MICROCLAW_HOME/clawhub.lock.json`)

Compatibility behavior:
- If legacy `<data_dir>/skills` already exists, runtime keeps using it until migrated.

## Config

In `microclaw.config.yaml`:

```yaml
clawhub_registry: "https://clawhub.ai"
clawhub_token: ""
clawhub_agent_tools_enabled: true
clawhub_skip_security_warnings: false
```

## Operational notes

- Keep `clawhub_skip_security_warnings: false` in production.
- Review `clawhub.lock.json` in CI for supply-chain traceability.
- Pin versions in automation instead of implicit latest.
